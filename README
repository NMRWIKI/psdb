This is the directory of open access pulse sequence library at NMR Wiki.

Contents is a plain directory tree containing only the essential bits
of the pulse sequences - i.e. everything needed to run the experiments,
except the external documentation.

What is PSDB?
=============
PSDB is an abbreviation for Pulse Sequence DataBase. You can freely
clone and extend this repository. Please contact NMR Wiki administrator
at admin@nmrwiki.org if you have further questions.

Why store psdb files in a directory under revision control?
===========================================================
The chosen directory structure is simple, predictable and is familiar
to most NMR spectrosopists, as you will recognize from the description
below. Components, such as shaped pulse waveforms
may be reused by multiple pulse sequences.

Directory tree is easy to keep under a version control system, which 
is essential to maintain integrity of a collection of interdependent
resources (individual files - such as pulse sequences, parameter files,
waveforms, etc.). Revision control has a concept of "commit" - an atomic
change of multiple resources, which helps to guarantee that the collection
of files is never in a "half-up-to-date" state and is always usable.

Finally, revision control allows rolling back any unwanted changes,
branching, as well as intelligent merges of the source code files.

What this repository does not have?
===================================
This git repository does not have extended documentation,
nor means to search the contents (not yet). These things are provided by the
NMR Wiki website: http://nmrwiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:PulseSequenceDatabase

Even though that documentation is not included here, it is still
freely available and copyable at the wiki site.

Directory structure
===================
Directories located at the root bear name(s) of the laboratory Principal Investigator(s).
Directory vendorlib is special - it is reserved to instrument vendors.

Each of those directories is an independent collection of pulse sequences and
accompanying resources.

For example, directory morris_nilsson is reserved for the laboratories of 
Drs. Morris and Nillson of Manchester University
and has the following structure internally:

morris_nillson/
    bruker/   #<--- subtree for pulse sequences in Bruker format
        au/
        lists/
            pp/ #<--with all the usual subdirectories
        par/

    vnmrsys/  #<--- subtree for pulse sequences in Varian format
        data/
        maclib/
        parlib/
        psglib/
        shapelib/

There are two subtrees - 'bruker' and 'vnmrsys' - for sequences in Bruker
and Varian format - respectively. Please feel free to add directory 
structures for other formats. The only requirement is that the structure
must be exactly like on the standard setup on the spectrometers.

Storage conventions
===================
Directory vnmrsys has one 'foreign' component called 'data' - it is
added to store .tar archives with sample data. In 'bruker' those archives
are to be placed in 'par' directory.

Again, an important convention at the moment is that sample data is
archived into .tar files - one per pulse sequence. 
That is done to allow easy download
of all things included into sample data sets at once.

Currently there is a convention - Sample data archive for the pulse
sequence must have name derived from the pulse sequence itself.

For example data for pulse sequence Oneshot has to be in the file
called Oneshot.tar and must either go into 'bruker/par' directory
or 'vnmrsys/data'.

This convention can change in the future.

Further development of psdb
===========================
The method described above is 'a method' and further ajustments
are quite possible. If you have suggestions - please email
"admin@nmrwiki.org" or any of the database maintainers you know.
